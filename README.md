# serverless-webapp
This project is a serverless web application built using AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB. The web application provides a simple interface to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items in a DynamoDB table. The API Gateway is used to provide a RESTful interface to the Lambda functions, which handle the CRUD operations. The application is entirely serverless, meaning there are no servers to manage, and it can scale automatically to handle any amount of traffic. This project can be used as a starting point for building serverless web applications on AWS.

## Getting Started
  you deploy the necessary services using AWS console or the Cloudformation Template 


## Architecture

The application is built using the following AWS services:

- API Gateway
- Lambda Functions
- DynamoDB

The API Gateway provides a RESTful interface to the Lambda functions, which handle the CRUD operations. The DynamoDB table stores the application data.
